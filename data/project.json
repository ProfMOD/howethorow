    "description": "An annotation of Susan Howe's poem \"Thorow Part III\" as performed for _Thiefth_, a collaboration between Howe and musician/composer David Grubb. Howe's \"Thorow\" is a feminist and decolonial critique of historical violence, written by the author while on the shores of Lake George in upstate New York. In creating the poem, Howe draws from the journals of Henry David Thorow and Sir William Johnson. This third section of the poem is a collage text--lines askew and conflicting, as Howe deconstructs the language of what she calls \"pathfinding believers in God and grammar.\"",
